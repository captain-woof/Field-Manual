# A Handy, Short Field Manual

Here is my repository of everything that I keep learning about how a certain thing works, (re)written in short and crisp language, so it's easy to quickly read and find what you need. Over time, more and more stuff will be added. Feel free to consult/read it. Wherever I have directly borrowed content from some other source, you'll find the source info in the folder's README.
