# Vulnserver

Vulnserver is an intentionally vulnerable server program that is designed for **one purpose only** - testing out your skills. It was written by Stephen Bradshaw around 2010. You will find Vulnserver's repo [here](https://github.com/stephenbradshaw/vulnserver).

Starting the server is easy:
`vulnserver.exe <port to bind to>`

**Default port is 9999**
