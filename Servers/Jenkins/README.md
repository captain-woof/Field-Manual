Executing commands on the host through Jenkins is easy. Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to /script (the Script Console)
2. You can execute Groovy script here. If you want a reverse shell, Google for 'Groovy reverse shell.' Also, you'll find one at the [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md#groovy) repo, on their 'Reverse Shell Cheat Sheet'.
