# README

For an explanation on how Kerberos works, I found an amazing article on [Tarlogic](https://www.tarlogic.com) written by an Eloy Perez. The flowchart you see here, is directly taken from [that article](https://www.tarlogic.com/en/blog/how-kerberos-works/). The flowchart is only for a reference. To understand it full, read the article.

The cheatsheet in this directory is also from Tarlogic, taken from here [https://gist.github.com/TarlogicSecurity/2f221924fef8c14a1d8e29f3cb5c5c4a](https://gist.github.com/TarlogicSecurity/2f221924fef8c14a1d8e29f3cb5c5c4a).
