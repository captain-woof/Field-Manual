# Pwntools
Pwntools is an excellent suite of tools and Python package that makes exploit scripting very, very easy.

Here's the link to its [Github Repo](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools). Installation and usage instructions are well documented there. For easy install:
```
pip3 install pwn
```

The cheatsheet is far from complete. I keep adding stuff as I learn and use them. 

**Complete documentation is [here](https://docs.pwntools.com/) and a list of tutorials are [here](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools-tutorial).**
