Tool currently extracts: Saved usernames, passwords, and site ID(URL of saved login details). ChromeTheif also grabs history, google searched keywords that were typed into google search engine, and autofill contents.

### Usage:

1. Download the binary and save it on your USB or local machine. Enter your USB drive into your PC and run the tool.
2. BE SURE CHROME IS NOT RUNNING OR TOOL WILL HANG 
3. Enter your USB Drive Letter with a colon and press enter. For example G:
4. This tool will create a folder on your USB called Chrome Dump and the files will be saved there.
5. If a ChromeDump folder already exists in the location where you are saving it, it will throw an error. Should be updating that soon.
